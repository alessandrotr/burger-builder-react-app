Everyone loves to eat a nice burger stuffed with bacon and cheese. We even add a bit of salad because we care about your health! But what's better than ordering it from the comfort of your home and have it delivered, while waiting comfortably on the couch? Nothing.

Burger Builder is the first Single Page Application that I built in React and Redux following a 40 hour Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course on Udemy, during which I learned the basics of React, React Router, React Hooks, Redux and much more.

I built the application differently from how it was built in the course, I added more features and changed the design entirely, so that everything is as compliant as possible to a real Web App.

In Burger Builder you can create your own account and build your own burger. You can choose the ingredients and how many of each you would like to add. Then a summary of the chosen ingredients will be depicted and you will be asked to enter your personal data. This will be sent to the server and saved in the "Orders" page, where all the orders you made with your account will appear.
